# Tech Blog - CMS-style Blog Application

## Description

The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site, similar to Wordpress, where developers can create and publish blog posts and interact by commenting on other developersâ€™ posts. This application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, making use of modern technologies such as Sequelize ORM, Handlebars.js for templating, and express-session for authentication.

The site is a platform for developers to share thoughts on technical concepts, advancements, and new technologies. Users can sign up, log in, create blog posts, edit or delete their own posts, and comment on others' posts.

Features
- User authentication (sign up, login, and logout).
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts.
- Modern UI: Clean, simple, and responsive design for a better user experience.
- Follows the MVC design pattern for clear separation of concerns.
